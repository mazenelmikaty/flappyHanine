        Hey Hanounaaa!!,  
        <br><br>
        I donâ€™t even know where to start, because no matter how many words I write, theyâ€™ll never really capture what you mean to me. 
        Youâ€™re not just my girlfriend â€” youâ€™re my first real one, the first person who actually made me feel like I wasnâ€™t broken 
        or meant to be alone forever. Before you, I had honestly accepted that Iâ€™d just go through life solo, watching everyone else 
        fall in love while I stayed in the background.  
        <br><br>
        Then you showed up and turned everything upside down â€” in the best way possible.  
        <br><br>
        Now, I canâ€™t even enjoy a single day without seeing your face or hearing your voice. Being away from you sucks more than I 
        ever thought something could suck. Itâ€™s like part of me is missing every time weâ€™re apart. I didnâ€™t even think I could feel 
        this attached to someone. And yet, here I am, hopelessly obsessed with you in the softest, mushiest way possible.  
        <br><br>
        I know I can be annoying sometimes and Iâ€™m really sorry for that. I just feel so comfortable 
        around you that I let all my weirdness out without filters. Youâ€™re my safe space, and sometimes that comes out as me teasing you 
        or messing around more than I probably should. But itâ€™s only because I love being close to you in every way.  
        <br><br>
        Iâ€™d seriously do anything for you. Like, no joke, if someoneâ€™s annoying you, just say the word â€” and as you know, I always got your back even if you kill someone ðŸ˜‰  
        <br><br>
        I donâ€™t know how you did it, but you changed everything for me. You made me believe in love, in the idea that 
        maybe I deserve this. That I deserve *you.*  
        <br><br>
        So yeah, this isnâ€™t some formal love letter. Itâ€™s just me, pouring my heart out in the most honest way I can. I love you, Hanine. 
        More than I ever thought I could love anyone.  
        <br><br>
        Yours always,  
        <br>
        Mouzi
